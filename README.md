This project automates the generation of a PDF report summarizing student performance based on data from a CSV file. It reads the student names and scores, calculates key statistics (average, maximum, and minimum scores), and formats the results into a professional PDF document using the FPDF library. The final report includes a summary and a detailed table of each student's score.
